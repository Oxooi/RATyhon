# RATyhon

This script will wait for a connection on the IP address and port defined in the ADRESSE and PORT constants.

Once a client is connected, you can send the following commands:

- close: Closes the connection with the client.
- mkdir: Creates a new directory.
- touch: Creates a new file.
- ls: Lists the contents of the current directory.
- cd: Changes the directory.
- rm: Removes a file.
- rmdir: Removes a directory.
- pwd: Displays the path of the current directory.
- screen: Takes a screenshot of the client.
- clear: Clears the console.
- cat: Displays the content of a file.

The results of these commands will be displayed in the console.
